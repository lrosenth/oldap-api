### Update 2026-06-06 00:23
- Decisions: Document the instance permission update contract in the OpenAPI spec after adding `oldap:attachedToRole` mutation support.
- Implementation: Added `InstanceCreateData`, `InstanceUpdateData`, `AttachedToRoleUpdate`, and `AttachedToRoleDelete` schemas to `API-def/oldap-api.yaml`; updated `/data/{project}/{resclass}` and `/data/{project}/{instiri}` request bodies with examples; documented the contract in `codex.md`.
- Open: Regenerate downstream typed clients from `API-def/oldap-api.yaml` where projects consume generated schemas.
- Risks/Assumptions: The instance payload remains ontology-driven via `additionalProperties: true`; only the OLDAP permission map is modeled explicitly.

### Update 2026-05-26 14:45
- Decisions: Keep `rdf:type` backward compatible by returning only explicit resource type assertions from the project data graph. Expose reasoning-derived types separately as `virtual:inferredTypes`.
- Implementation: Updated instance read response shaping, OpenAPI `InstanceData`, and the read-instance regression test.
- Open: None.
- Risks/Assumptions: Assumes explicit `rdf:type` assertions in the project data graph represent the API-compatible resource class contract.
